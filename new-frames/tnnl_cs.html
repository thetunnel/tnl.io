Inspired by the harsh reality of growing up in the inner city of an Ohioan metropolis, Mr. Irvin has found comfort and solace in his musical pursuits during his life&#8217;s darkest moments. He has collaborated with budding talents in various regions of the United States as well as international acts. Though he shows promise as a performing artist himself, Xitruc admits that he does not wish to see his own name in lights. His dream is to weave the primordial threads which will ultimately bloom into a tapestry of musical genius, beloved by all. When not pursing his production career, Mr. Irvin enjoys travel, rooting for teams from his hometown of Cleveland, spending time with his family, and other various recreational pursuits. Through his dedication to his craft, Xitruc NiVri is an embodiment of resilience and redemption despite the copious setbacks which cast a shadow over his earliest years. <br/><br/></span><span style="font-size:15pt; font-family:'ST MicroSquare'; color:#D1C3C3; font-weight:bold; ">ALJ<br/></span><span style="font-size:11pt; font-family:'Arial Narrow'; color:#D1C3C3; font-weight:bold; ">Anthony Louis Johnson (Lil&#8216; Tony, King Aioli) is a 21 year old musician on the rise hailing from Bridgeport, Connecticut, USA (better known to him as Suplex City), he is an attendant of a prestigious music school and a student of the works of 2Pac, Outlawz, Odd Future, The Internet, Snoop Dogg, The Dogg Pound, Charlie Wilson, Luther Vandross, J Dilla, N.E.R.D, Kirk Franklin, A Tribe Called Quest, Fit For Rivals, PEACECAMP, Eyme Santos, Eminem, D12, Busta Rhymes, All-American Rejects, De La Soul, Swizz Beatz, DMX, The LOX, Eve, and all making him a master of production.
