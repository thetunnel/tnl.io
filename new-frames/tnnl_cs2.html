I want new companionships and I just wanna imagine a place for the hopless, homicidal, suicidal, fearful, traumatized, addicted, and the weak so we can develop our strengths and then we&#8216;ll be free from stress. A tunnel where we can all celebrate life in general. A new home of peace and maintenance. A new home for us. If ypu&#8216;re an ex-fan, and your idols or whoever&#8216;s disrespecting you a lot, glorifying their luxury, leaving you to rot, all that BS just to steal, kill, or ruin everything you worked hard for, this is the spot you move to.You&#8216;re welcome to live in this tunnel as much as you like. If you&#8216;re itching to kill someone but something&#8216;s stopping you from wanting to go out and do all that, this is the spot. Addicted to something crazy you were introduced to (wrong path)? We&#8216;re always here. We do whatever we want in this tunnel. To everybody peeping the rest of our content that may as well breathe more than just life, we want our peers to use the rest of our music or everybody else's music as your helper as you go on, and know that we really ain't got time for recognition nor clout. Mental and spiritual healing practices [back and forth, up and down, left and right, on and off] are really tougher and tougher. But it&#8216;s always up to us children, especially The Tunnel, to make more than just a difference in our lives. Creativity is the best part of all healing processes. It&#8216;s also revenge. Forgive yourself. Recover yourself. Heal yourself. Love yourself. Trust yourself. Believe in yourself. Be yourself. Regain the strength of special energy. The weight and the fate of the world and humanity has been laying on our shoulders too much. All we gotta do is dance away the disasters of our lives. Dance away our horrendous mistakes. Dance away the negative energy. Change the colors of the dance floor into something internationally passionate. We, as people of one nation under God and better deed, are The Tunnel. Let there be more light in our everything than it is in everyone else&#8216;s.<br/><br/>Sincerly, <br/>Aioli (ALJ).<br/><br/>- via June 17, 2020-September 11, 2022</span>  </div>
